# 8. Coffee Shop: Animations

To create a better user experience, most websites use animations such as on-load page fade in, scroll animations or simple hover effects.

Let's add some animations to our Coffee Shop website. Using transition or animation/keyframes, recreate the following animations:

*   Button Animation
    *   When a user clicks the any action button, this animation will occur.
    *   Hint: You will need a CSS pseudo-class to know when a user clicks.
*   Spin Animation
    *   When a user hovers over the tilted can box (including the abstract line image), the can should infinitely rotate, completing one rotation in two seconds.
*   Flashing Animation
    *   The discount code box should flash from its original color to the color used by the action button. The animation occurs over two and a half seconds.
